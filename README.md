# Project Title
Our product, _BubbleBots_, is a web service that allows an educational aspect to learning AI gametrees when playing Checkers. A student may load the web service and play against a provided AI. While also seeing the AI's thinking process when playing the game. While the user is able to view the AI's thinking process, the web service provides a textual explanation.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help get you a copy of the webpage game up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Make sure to have the following Prerequisites installed on your local machine
- Web browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Code editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Xcode)
  
### Installation
If you would like to install the development on your local machine, we recommend doing the following:
- Clone the repository to your local machine using:
    git clone https://github.com/N1ckP3rsl3y/TheBubbleBots.git
- cd into the directory
    cd TheBubbleBots
  
## Running the Tests
The following will show you how to run automated tests for the webpage game

### End-to-End Tests
The following tests will ensure that the game works correctly with all components.
To run end-to-end tests, we recommend doing the following:
  * Use js as the web testing framework (e.g. Pytest)
  * Use GitHub actions to automatically run tests every time a pull or push request occurs.
    
### Coding Style Tests
The following tests ensure that the code meets the coding standards.
* [cpplint](https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint) - used for C testing
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - used for JavaScript testing 
* [atatus](https://www.atatus.com/) - used for HTML testing
* [csslint](http://csslint.net/) - used for CSS testing

## Deployment

Due to the fact that the class requires something to be written in C, the web server will be written and deployed in C

## Built With

* [Hostwinds](https://www.hostwinds.com/) - running web server
* [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/contents.html#) - Used for testing
* [C](https://www.cprogramming.com/) - creating web server
