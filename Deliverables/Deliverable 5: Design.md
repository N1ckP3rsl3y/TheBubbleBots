### Description
Bubble Bots is a web-based application that allows students, gamers, and developers to challenge AI in checkers. While doing so, you can see what itâ€™s thinking, in real time, and analyze what pattern the computer is taking and what it thinks is the best option to win. An educational gaming experience into the world of AI that stands apart by not only allowing you to play but truly understand the underlying mechanics of AI.
