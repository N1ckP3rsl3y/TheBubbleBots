### Description
Bubble Bots is a web-based application that allows students, gamers, and developers to challenge AI in checkers. While doing so, you can see what it’s thinking, in real time, and analyze what pattern the computer is taking and what it thinks is the best option to win. An educational gaming experience into the world of AI that stands apart by not only allowing you to play but truly understand the underlying mechanics of AI.

Use Cases:
1) Move Request - Allows the user to make a move that will then be displayed on screen. Then, the back-end will calculate a response by updating the position for the AI bot's decision and update the textual and visualization descriptions.

2) Update settings - This allows the user to update how they would like the AI bot to act during the next move. This will be checked for and updated after every player move, and before the bot's move.

3) Give Feedback - Users can give feedback on the website when they feel that they would like to the programmers to know what's going on.
