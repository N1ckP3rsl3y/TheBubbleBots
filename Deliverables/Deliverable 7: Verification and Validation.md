## Description

## Verification

## Acceptance Test
For acceptance testing, we decided to use Selenium delivered via the Pytest Python library. Selenium is an open-source testing framework that focuses on browser automation and supports a huge number of programming languages.\
[Automated Acceptance Tests](https://github.com/N1ckP3rsl3y/TheBubbleBots/blob/main/testing/acceptance_test.py) \
[Example Acceptance Test](https://github.com/N1ckP3rsl3y/TheBubbleBots/actions/runs/7078527014/job/19264113247) \
In this acceptance test, we are creating an internet browser environment that first navigates to our website. After doing so, the test will then search for our button objects and press each of them. Upon clicking the links, we ensure that we actually navigate to the desired destination and that those buttons are functioning visually from a user interface standpoint. Lastly, the test checks that the desired page is properly loaded and visually available.

### Interview #3

Aaron  (interviewee)

1. Could you work with the website for a few minutes and let us know what your first impressions are?
   * I was very confused because I could not move any of the checkers on the board, and it seems like the board was stretching below my screen, if that makes sense. I realized after I skipped the about page. Maybe having a button next to the start here button that says tutorial will be helpful.

2. How would you compare this to actual checkers?
   * I think it's very similar to checkers, I like how responsive it is.
3. What is your least favorite aspect of the website?
   * The weird background. The bugs I experienced as well.
4. What is your favorite aspect of the website?
   * I like how fast the pieces move in the game.
5. What recommendations do you have for the website?
   * A better background image and sounds for when the checkers move.
6. Would you recommend this website to others?
   * Yes, if they want to play checkers online
7. Do you like the look and feel of the website?
   * I like the feel, but the look could be a little better
8. Do you think the website is easy to navigate?
   * I think this website is pretty easy to navigate and really fast.
9. Do you like the how-to-play section on the About page?
   * Yes, I think it would be cool if it had a pop-up I could reference while on the game page.

### Interview #4

James  (interviewee)

1. Could you work with the website for a few minutes and let us know what your first impressions are? 
   * Good functionality, but was slightly confused on what the website was about upon arrival. Also had issues starting the game. 
2. How would you compare this to actual checkers? 
   * Similar, but does need some tweaking ('Kinging' at the opposite end, pawns switch sides halfway through the board, can move backwards, and the lack of the ability to double jump)
3. What is your least favorite aspect of the website? 
   * The 'About' page font was way too large. 
4. What is your favorite aspect of the website? 
   * The ability to play Checkers quick & easy, with adjustable difficulty sliders. 
5. What recommendations do you have for the website?
   * Adjustments to the 'About' page, less extreme colors, & landing page needs tweaking (not much to catch the eye or explain why someone should continue through your website) 
6. Would you recommend this website to others? 
   * Yes 
7. Do you like the look and feel of the website? 
   * Navigation FEELS good

9. Do you like the how-to-play section on the About page?
