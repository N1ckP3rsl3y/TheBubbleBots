### 7. User stories:
Elian: 
1. As a gamer who loves board games I would like to challenge an AI to play games of my liking so that I can get the satisfaction of       beating AI 
2. As a person who likes a challenge I want to play against an AI and see if the level of thinking is the same as mine.

Jeysen A:
1. As a game enthusiast who enjoys gaming during my free time, I want to be able to play board games online so that I can have an incredible gaming experience playing against an AI.
2. As a student who is currently enrolled in an HTML course, I want to learn the fundamentals of how online games that use AI work, so that in the future I can try to create my own board game that plays against the AI.
