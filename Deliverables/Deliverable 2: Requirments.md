## Team Deliverable #2: Requirements

Project Name - BubbleBots

Date: 10/1/2023

Location: Virtual (Discord)

Team Members: Nicholas Persley, Nicholas Robishaw, Elian Zamora-Rivera, Jeysen Angous, Tyler Chapp, Ibrahim Hmood

### 1. Positioning:
_Problem Statment_
The problem of modern AI in games is that they can be boring and mundane, the players can't see what the AI is thinking. The impact of which is repetitive AI doing the same tasks and upcoming developers who study how to implement AI make the same mistake.

_Product Position Statement_

_Value proposition and customer segment_


### 2. Stakeholders:

   1. **Gamers** - typical day-to-day gamers who love gaming, their responsibility is to play the game and engage with the gaming content.
   2. **Streaming Platforms** - platforms like Twitch and YouTube will stream/broadcast the website using ads featuring all the games to the global audience. It will promote viewer engagement by encouraging the players to visit the website and take part in the online gaming experience.
   3. **AI enthusiasts** - individuals who have a strong interest in AI and are interested in AI decision-making. Their responsibility is to see what decision(s) the AI makes in the game and to see the result of that game-making decision(s).


### 3. Functional requirements (features):


### 4. Non-functional requirements:
1. Portability: our system needs to be able to run on different platforms with minimal adaptation

- Measurement: Once we are able to interact with our site from Linux, Mac, and Windows systems.

2. Availability: our system needs to be available when users want to access it

- Measurement: Once our system is accessible 24/7.

3.  Usability: our system needs to be easy to use and understand

- Measurement: Positive user feedback.

4. Compatibility: Our system needs to be compatible with multiple systems.

- Measurement:  Once we are able to interact with our site from Linux, Mac, and Windows systems.

5. Scalability: Because we will start with a small number of games and increase games offered as well as potential users, our system will need to be scalable.

- Measurement: User numbers and user feedback.

6. Performance: our system needs to be able to handle all AI bot instances, as well as a varying number of users.

- Measurement: High user numbers.

### 5. Minimum Viable Product:
Our minimal viable product is a program that allows users to play against bots and shows to the user a list of decisions the bot is going through before making a move. Those are also the features we intend on validating. We intend on validating these features using early user feedback.

### 6. Use cases:
Elian:
| Use Case | Player uses website |
| --- | --- |
| Actor | Player |
| flow | -The player opens up the website <br /> -Player then chooses a game to play<br /> -Player set’s difficulty <br /> -Player plays game on set difficulty. <br /> -Player can replay games<br />-Player beats AI every time!|
| Alternative Flow | -The player opens up the website<br /> -Checks about tab to see how website works. <br /> -Players goes back to main screen<br /> -Player then chooses a game to play<br /> -Player set’s difficulty <br /> -Player plays game on set difficulty. <br /> -Player can replay games<br /> -Player beats AI every time! |

Nick R:
| Use Case | Player studying the bots |
| --- | --- |
| Actor | Student |
| Flow | -When logging onto the Bubble Bots website, the student plays a selection of games and records the AI’s moves and thoughts. The student writes the notes depending on the game style. The student plays the game. Then look at the text display next to the game window. Then I can try playing again to look for different outcomes. The student then eliminates all duplicate outcomes. |
| Alternative Flow | If the student doesn't get any different outcomes when trying different strategies against the bot then an issue can be reported to the game forms. |
