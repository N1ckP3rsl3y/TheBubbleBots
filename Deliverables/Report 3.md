### Summary of Activities
Nick R: My part - I researched about C servers, and learned the basics for what Nick P presented to us in our meeting. I looked into the HTML/ CSS examples on how to create functioning game boards. During the meeting we went over the web server, and went over team roles. I wrote down notes from the meeting and posted it in our google drive folder for later use.

### Project Perspective

  1.Nick R: I appreciate that Nick P took some time and created a web server for us all to access and use for our project. Since Nick P is taking networking he was easily able to create this webserver. I appreciate that every team member is easy to work with and communicates very clearly and concise during meetings.
  
  2.Nick R: Dividing our skills and branching out to gather more information and teach other group members about certain things that we were tasked to research.
  
  3.Nick R: None

  5.Nick R: Maybe getting a jump start on developing our first game.
