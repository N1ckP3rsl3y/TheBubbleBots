### Summary of Activities
Nick R: My part - I researched about C servers, and learned the basics for what Nick P presented to us in our meeting. I looked into the HTML/ CSS examples on how to create functioning game boards. During the meeting we went over the web server, and went over team roles. I wrote down notes from the meeting and posted it in our google drive folder for later use.

Tyler Chapp â€“ I conducted some research in C client and servers using TCP/IP with socket programming and some introductory hands-on experience. In our meeting, Nick P. showed us all a C HTTP web server that he has been starting some beginning work on for this project. We sat down and talked about our roles moving forward such as who will be working front-end and back-end. 

### Project Perspective

  1. Nick R: I appreciate that Nick P took some time and created a web server for us all to access and use for our project. Since Nick P is taking networking he was easily able to create this webserver. I appreciate that every team member is easy to work with and communicates very clearly and concise during meetings.

  Tyler C: Nick P. put in some time this week to get a good starting point for us in this project. We now have a HTTP server written in C as a first building block to our product.
  
  2. Nick R: Dividing our skills and branching out to gather more information and teach other group members about certain things that we were tasked to research.
     
     Tyler C: We all were here for the meeting this week and have made a lot of progress such as deciding what games we will include in our website 
  
  3. Nick R: None
     
     Tyler C:	No failures to report this week.
  
  4. Nick R: None
     
     Tyler C: No barriers to report this week.
  
  5. Nick R: Maybe getting a jump start on developing our first game.
     Tyler C: Begin creating the games for our site.

### Next Steps
Now that we have a good starting point to build off of, moving forward we will have the front end and back end members of our team begin working on their respective parts more in depth on the product.
