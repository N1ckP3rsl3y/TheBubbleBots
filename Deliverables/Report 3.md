### Summary of Activities
Nick R: My part - I researched about C servers, and learned the basics for what Nick P presented to us in our meeting. I looked into the HTML/ CSS examples on how to create functioning game boards. During the meeting we went over the web server, and went over team roles. I wrote down notes from the meeting and posted it in our google drive folder for later use.

Tyler Chapp – I conducted some research in C client and servers using TCP/IP with socket programming and some introductory hands-on experience. In our meeting, Nick P. showed us all a C HTTP web server that he has been starting some beginning work on for this project. We sat down and talked about our roles moving forward such as who will be working front-end and back-end. 

Jeysen Angous – After conducting the interviews, I began doing some research on how to begin conducting the front-end web development of the webpage and how to make it look the best it can be. We assigned roles and I ended up taking the front-end web development. Nick the Group leader showed us the backend of the server and how the server would work using C Programming Language.

Elian Zamora = Nick P. showed us the code to the server we are going to use and explained to us the process of making the server in C. We also talked about our the rolls each one of us are going to be taking on during the next few weeks. 

### Project Perspective

  1. Appreciations
     
     Nick R: I appreciate that Nick P took some time and created a web server for us all to access and use for our project. Since Nick P is taking networking he was easily able to create this webserver. I appreciate that every team member is easy to work with and communicates very clearly and concise during meetings.

     Tyler C: Nick P. put in some time this week to get a good starting point for us in this project. We now have a HTTP server written in C as a first building block to our product.

     Jeysen A: Begin working on the front and back end of web-development

     Elian: Getting started on a rough draft for the front end development

     Nick P: Do more research on front/back-end features/responsibilities to get the ball rolling faster

### Next Steps
Now that we have a good starting point to build off of, moving forward we will have the front end and back end members of our team begin working on their respective parts more in depth on the product.
