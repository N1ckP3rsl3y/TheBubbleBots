### 5. Decision-making process
Majority rules (at least 4/6 people agree).

### 6. Non-Performing Team Members
If there is a non-performing team member, since Nicholas Persley was the one to create the project idea, concerned team members will address him. Upon agreeing with these statements, he will discuss it with the non-performing team member one-on-one. And if this continues, the team will have a meeting with this member and talk to them. If this gets bad enough, the team will then confront the professor (Professor Palmer) of this and go from there. If the non-performing team member is Nicholas Persley, the team will have a team meeting with him and discuss the problems that arose. If this continues, the team will address the professor (Professor Palmer) and again, go from there.


### 7. Project idea
A website that provides various board games with an agent (bot) to play against. And provides an educational list of its decisions the bot is going through to make its move. Along with the ability to play against a human, if so desired.

### 8. Technologies
As a group, we are all decently familiar with C, CSS, and HTML but are all inexperienced with ExpressJS and JavaScript. To learn more about these topics we will use a divide and conquer method to split up the required research. StackOverflow is a resource we will use to problem solve. 

### 9. Collaboration tools
We have all joined the collaboration on Canvas and created a Discord where we can all stay in contact.
### 10. Next steps
We will lightly research our technologies (ExpressJS, JavaScript, etc.) and reconvene at one of our specified times and discuss our findings until development officially begins.
