# System Description


Learning **AI** decision-making processes through a textbook can be challenging, frustrating, and time-consuming. New **AI** programmers struggle to come up with imaginary decision trees in their heads and don't have the experience to see any holes in their **AI** algorithms. The BubbleBots wants to eliminate all the hard thinking that new **AI** programmers deal with by showing what the **AI** is thinking and creating a good **visualization** foundation for the programmer. The BubbleBots will be an educational **website** that will show what the AI is thinking both **visually** through a game tree and **textually** in an English format. This will take the challenges from learning through a textbook and match them with an interactive virtual learning environment for **users** to play around with **AI** tools and see how they work.

BubbleBots will have a variety of stakeholders including game developers, **AI** enthusiasts, and new **AI** programmers. Furthermore, game developers are tasked with creating new challenging **AI** to hook a niche group of gamers. Currently, game audiences are favoring player versus player over player versus environment, with technology becoming more advanced by growing and progressing at a rapid pace, it's safe to say that **AI** is becoming more relevant in gaming each day. **AI** enthusiasts are individuals who have a strong interest in **AI** decision-making, these types of stakeholders already have some expertise when it comes to **AI** decision-making and want to sharpen their knowledge and skills. Lastly, new **AI** programmers can simply be described as students in the **AI** world who want to take on the challenge of learning about **AI**-powered programming tools and use those tools to see all the opportunities that **AI** has to offer. 

BubbleBots has a multitude of requirements. One of these is that BubbleBots must allow a **user** to play only checkers. Another requirement is fairly simple: a homepage. It needs a homepage that gives easy access to the game. It also has an about page, which explains what the website is and how it works. As stated, the only game BubbleBots can allow a **user** to play is checkers. For that game, BubbleBots provides an **AI** that **users** play against. This **AI** must calculate the positions of its own pieces. The **AI** must also provide explanations for its ***moves***, and those explanations must be displayed in sections on the front end during a game. How deep its explanations are must be something the **user** can customize too. This also includes game ***difficulty*** and how fast the **AI** explains its ***moves***. After finishing a game, BubbleBots must give the **user** the option to play again. It must also show details such as a win/loss ***score*** counter, and must show position calculations for both the **user** and the **AI**. Given that **users** are bound to experience issues, BubbleBots must allow them to submit feedback directly.  BubbleBots has some more requirements, and they are non-functional. These requirements include that it must be portable, available, and usable. For portability, the system must be able to run on different platforms with little to no changes. To ensure that BubbleBots works on multiple platforms, we will measure how many different platforms it can run on (like Mac, Linux, Windows, etc). For availability, we need our system to be available for whenever **users** want to access it. We can make sure BubbleBots is always available by checking if it is available 24/7. Not only must BubbleBots be portable and always available, it must also be easy to use, and compatible with multiple systems. It must also be scalable in some way, be able to handle all **AI** instances, and varying numbers of **users**. Since BubbleBots is, among other things, intended for educational use, then it must be easy to use and understand. We can ensure this by measuring the amount of positive **user** feedback. BubbleBots must also be compatible with multiple systems, such as Mac or Linux, which can be measured by how many different systems we are able to get to interact with BubbleBots. Not only must it be cross-system compatible, it must also be scalable in some way. In order for us to ensure scalability, we will use **user** numbers and feedback as measurements. Finally, our system must be able to handle all **AI** instances and varying **user** numbers. In order for BubbleBots to meet this requirement, we will measure **user** numbers and adjust accordingly.
