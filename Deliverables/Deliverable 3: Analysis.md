# System Description


Learning AI decision-making processes through a textbook can be challenging, frustrating, and time-consuming. New AI programmers struggle to come up with imaginary decision trees in their heads and don't have the experience to see any holes in their AI algorithms. The BubbleBots wants to eliminate all the hard thinking that new AI programmers deal with by showing what the AI is thinking and creating a good visualization foundation for the programmer. The BubbleBots will be an educational website that will show what the AI is thinking both visually through a game tree and textually in an English format. This will take the challenges from learning through a textbook and match them with an interactive virtual learning environment for users to play around with AI tools and see how they work.

BubbleBots will have a variety of stakeholders including game developers, AI enthusiasts, and new AI programmers. Furthermore, game developers are tasked with creating new challenging AI to hook a niche group of gamers. Currently, game audiences are favoring player versus player over player versus environment, with technology becoming more advanced by growing and progressing at a rapid pace, it's safe to say that AI is becoming more relevant in gaming each day. AI enthusiasts are individuals who have a strong interest in AI decision-making, these types of stakeholders already have some expertise when it comes to AI decision-making and want to sharpen their knowledge and skills. Lastly, new AI programmers can simply be described as students in the AI world who want to take on the challenge of learning about AI-powered programming tools and use those tools to see all the opportunities that AI has to offer.

# User Stories
1. As an AI enthusiast I want to be able to have a visual representation of the AI decision making it easier to understand the thought process an AI has and be able to distribute that knowledge to other enthusiasts.
   
2. As an AI teacher I would like to use BubbleBots to have a deeper understanding of AI thought process and to help my students have a better understanding on how AI could be applied to real world problems or situations.

3. As an avid visual learner, I want to be able to learn more than what is presented to me on a typical board game website by visually understanding what the intelligent agent is doing when making a move.
