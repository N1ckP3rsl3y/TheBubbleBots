# System Description


Learning AI decision making processes through a textbook can be challenging, frustrating, and time consuming. New AI programmers struggle coming up with imaginary decision trees in their heads, and don't have the experience to see any holes in their AI algorithms. The BubbleBots wants to eliminate all the hard thinking that new AI programmers deal with by showing what the AI is thinking and creating a good visualization foundation for the programmer. The BubbleBots will be an educational website that will show what the AI is thinking both visually through a game tree and textually in an English format. This will take the challenges from learning through a textbook and match it with an interactive virtual learning environment for users to play around with AI tools and see how they work.
