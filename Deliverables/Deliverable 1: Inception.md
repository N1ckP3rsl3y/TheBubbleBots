## Project Name - BubbleBots
## Date: 9/15/23

## Team Members: Nicholas Persley, Nicholas Robishaw, Elian Zamora-Rivera, Jeysen Angous, Tyler Chapp, Ibrahim Hmood

## Introduction
The world of AI is growing rapidly these days. Everywhere you hear, “AI this” and “AI that.” You can go online and chat with, play against, and work with provided intelligent agents. But what does it all mean? Not many people know what or how the agent is doing what it so rapidly shows on the screen. This is where our product, TheBubbleBots, an educational website to provide information to the player of what simple agents do, comes in.

## Initial Value Proposition
Our product is going to provide users with an educational and fun experience playing board games online. We are interested in trying to combine people who have interest both in board games and/or artificial intelligence no matter their experience level. While including these groups, students are a target as well, especially ones that are software-driven. They will be able to start their learning journey by learning the basics of artificial intelligence.
