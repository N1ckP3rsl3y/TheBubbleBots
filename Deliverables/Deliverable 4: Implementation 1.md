### Introduction
Bubble Bots is a web-based application that allows students, gamers, and developers to challenge AI in checkers. While doing so, you can see what it’s thinking, in real time, and analyze what pattern the computer is taking and what it thinks is the best option to win. An educational gaming experience into the world of AI that stands apart by not only allowing you to play but truly understand the underlying mechanics of AI.

### Tests

We will mainly be using pytest for back end and some front end.

### Adopted Technologies

C & HostWinds for the web server - Due to the fact that the class requires something to be written in C, the web server will be written in C. This will not be written in C++ due to the fact of prior experience with writing a server in C. And HostWinds will be a server that runs the web server in the background for users to connect to for testing purposes up until the deployment.\
JavaScript - Our project will have to collect input from user.


### Learning/Training

The team will work from their current knowledge base. And when something is encountered that one may not know, the go-to is the documentation of the language feature at hand. Upon no progress being made, the team member can ask the other members for their input/help. If the problem at hand is not specifically a language feature but something built with the languages (e.g., web server), the person may look to online resources for assistance (e.g., YouTube or articles) or, again, ask their other team members if they can assist, and learn from them. It is worth mentioning that the learning of something one has never dealt with before, shall not wait until the day before submission to look into. Meaning that learning from another person or from online, will not be done last minute.


### Deployment

Because the created web server is written in C, we will be using HostWinds for people to connect to. We will then use a Linux-provided ability to run a program in the background without the user being active (logged in) on the server. Furthermore, we will make use of paying for a domain for the website. This is to not provide someone with an IP which is easy to forget. So, the link to this web site is http://www.bubblebots.xyz:1034/.

### Look & Feel

The approach we used to design our landing page was HTML and CSS. 
We started off by creating a page that has a navigation bar that allows you to switch between the main page and an about page to describe how to play the game. There is a welcome message right In the middle of the page welcoming the user to the Bubblebots site and asking the user if he/she is ready to play. Under this message there is a play button that will allow the user to go to the game page and from there the user can start playing the game. This layout makes our landing page easy to use and takes the user straight to the game with just one click. Our game page implements a gameboard as well as boxes for the settings, visual representation and text explination.


### Lessons Learned

The team learned how to work in subteams, come together, and create a working website. The front-end team learned how to correctly format and organize a web page. This includes making a cut-out game board along with settings, text output, and visualization boxes to take up different sections of the display. The front-end team divided up these objects so later implementation of game pieces and AI responses will be easy to implement when the team is ready. The back-end team learned how to create a whole web server in C using sockets and threads. Pytest is still something the team is learning, but it will be a tool that both the front and back ends will utilize. Overall, the team expanded their skills in something out of their usual comfort zone to put together a working website ready for the next implementation.
