### Tests

We will mainly be using pytest for back end and some front end. \

### Adopted Technologies

C & HostWinds for the web server - Due to the fact that the class requires something to be written in C, the web server will be written in C. This will not be written in C++ due to the fact of prior experience with writing a server in C. And HostWinds will be a server that runs the web server in the background for users to connect to for testing purposes up until the deployment.\
	JavaScript - Our project will have to collect input from user.\
