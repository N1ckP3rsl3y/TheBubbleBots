### Tests
BubbleBots utilizes the unit testing frameworks Pytest and Jest to test code in with python and javascript respectively. The functionality of our C server is being tested with the Pytest requests package which ensures the website's necessary files are being delivered. Our Jest javascript tests are testing the basic functionality of our checkers game. These tests are set to automatically build a testing environment and run both tests anytime a commit occurs in our GitHub repository. A more detailed example of how we are testing the functionality of the checkers game, with Jest, is with an element called query selector. This testing element searches a pageâ€™s script for specified objects. In the case of our Jest file, we search for the existence of our black and red game pieces which confirms proper rendering.

### Demo
### Code quality
- The team is using two programming languages which are C and JavaScript as well as two web programming scripting languages which are HTML, and CSS. Furthermore, coding style tests like cpplint, ESLint, atatus, and csslint are used that meet the coding standards. After a team member writes a piece of code another team member views the code and tries to identify any bugs and or ways to improve the code following the coding standards. Automated testing for both C and JavaScript programming languages is used. Lastly, the team does weekly maintenance in ways to improve code quality and take care of any issues that arise.
### Lessons Learned

- The main lesson learned is that development will most likely take a lot longer than originally planned. Going into this, the plan was to have a fully functional AI bot to play checkers against. But problems come up and more time must be allowed for this. So, when dealing with implementations, it is best to start earlier than later no matter the section of the program.
- Throughout a couple of implementations, it has become clear that knowledge on GitHub could be improved upon. So, throughout the deliverables, the team has started to learn about GitHub and as a result can build upon that knowledge. This is important since GitHub is a program that will most likely be used in industry.
- The above points are the main problems/lessons from this implementation. If we were to continue with this implementation, we would attempt to start the assigned implementations as soon as possible. While the fact is that the semester may not allow for this, it would be better to start earlier than cram things in the last three days. And continuing to use GitHub would be a priority because of its functionality and usefulness it provides for developers, along with the fact that it would be better to learn during school than when in a new job.
