### Code quality
### Lessons Learned

- The main lesson learned is that development will most likely take a lot longer than originally planned. Going into this, the plan was to have a fully functional AI bot to play checkers against. But problems come up and more time must be allowed for this. So, when dealing with implementations, it is best to start earlier than later no matter the section of the program.
- Throughout a couple of implementations, it has become clear that knowledge on GitHub could be improved upon. So, throughout the deliverables, the team has started to learn about GitHub and as a result can build upon that knowledge. This is important since GitHub is a program that will most likely be used in industry.
- The above points are the main problems/lessons from this implementation. If we were to continue with this implementation, we would attempt to start the assigned implementations as soon as possible. While the fact is that the semester may not allow for this, it would be better to start earlier than cram things in the last three days. And continuing to use GitHub would be a priority because of its functionality and usefulness it provides for developers, along with the fact that it would be better to learn during school than when in a new job.
